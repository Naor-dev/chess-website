# Enable UX Advisor

Create symlink to enable the skill:

```bash
ln -sf /path/to/web-design-knowledge ~/.claude/skills/ux-advisor
```

**IMPORTANT**: Replace `/path/to/web-design-knowledge` with your actual installation path.

After running this command, output:

```
UX Advisor ENABLED

Restart Claude Code to activate the skill. Then you can ask design questions naturally:
- "What colors work for a fintech dashboard?"
- "How should I layout an e-commerce product page?"
- "Best practices for checkout UX?"

To disable: /ux-advisor-off
```
